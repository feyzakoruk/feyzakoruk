--> Hey there! I am Feyza Koruk, an Electrical and Electronics Engineering sophomore at Bilkent University. 

- I am currently learning Java as a result of my newfound passion for coding after realizing that I might have a knack for it.

- I know Python and VHDL and on the path of learning many more!

- A small fun fact about me: Despite the stereotype for devs, I love literature and am especially enamoured with Shakespeare!
